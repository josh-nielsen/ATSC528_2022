    "\n",
    "This script examines chaos using the system of ordinary differential equations\n",
    "examined by Lorenz in 1984, 1990, and 2006. The equations were solved using\n",
    "forward time differencing before being coded into the script. Then the constants \n",
    "in the equations were defined and two sets of initial conditions were given. Then \n",
    "the timestep was defined and the number of total steps was calculated. Arrays to \n",
    "hold the data were created. Then the simulations were ran for each set of initial \n",
    "conditions. After this, 3 plots were created comparing the differences in x, y, \n",
    "and z for each simulation. The differences in x, y, and z show how chaos manifests,\n",
    "even with very minor changes in initial conditions.\n",
